<h1>Angry Bob</h1>
<p class="story">Bob was angry. “I know,” Bob said. “I will go eat a donut. Maybe then I will be happy.” He walked down the street to Danny’s Doughnut Store. He went inside and looked at the menu. “So many choices,” he said to himself. Glazed, Chocolate, Maple, Strawberry Frosting, Old-Fashioned. He gazed down the menu until something caught his eye. “I will get a jelly doughnut,” he told Danny. Danny picked up the doughnut. “For here or to go?” he asked Bob. “For here,” Bob replied, wanting no delay in his happiness. “That’ll be $2.75,” Danny said, as he put the doughnut in a white paper bag. Bob handed him a five dollar bill. “Keep the change,” Bob said. “Thanks, Bob,” Danny said gratefully, as he handed Bob the doughnut. Bob went to the nearest booth and sat down. He took the jelly doughnut out of the white paper bag. The bag made a soft rustle as he put it aside. He closed his eyes and bit into the doughnut. The doughnut tasted warm and sweet. The sweet strawberry jelly filled his mouth. It was delicious. “Now,” Bob said, smiling, “I am truly happy.” He continued to eat the doughnut until there was no more. As he ate the last bite, some of the jelly fell onto his shirt and stained it. “That’s okay,” he said, “for today, I am truly happy. I will clean it off at home.” He thanked Danny and was about to leave the store, when Danny called out: “Wait!” Bob turned around. “It’s your lucky day!” Danny exclaimed, “Since you are my 100th customer today, you have won a brand new A400 Semiautomatic Shotgun!” “Really?” Bob said. Danny replied, “Of course!” He handed Bob the gun and Bob, thanking him, left Danny’s Doughnut Shop with the gun. “Today I am happy and lucky!” He began walking down the street back home. “Beautiful day, isn’t it?” Bob said to a man driving his 1982 Ford F-150. The man looked at Bob and, without replying, sped away. “Strange man,” Bob said. But that didn't bother him, since he was truly happy. A family was approaching from the other side. He tried again. “Hey folks! How are you?” The mom covered the child’s eyes as they turned around and walked the other way. “Now, that was rude!” he called after them. But he wasn’t deterred, since today, he was truly happy. He continued walking. “Nothing can ruin my day today,” he said aloud, for everyone to hear. “Nothing.” As he was walking, he came across a dead body lying in the middle of the sidewalk. “Oh my!” Bob exclaimed, as he went closer to look. As soon as he got to the body, however, he heard a voice behind him say, “Don’t move!” “Who, me?” Bob said, turning around. He saw three armed policemen standing with their guns trained at him. “You must be mistaken. I have committed no crime. I just went out to buy a doughnut.” “Well the gun and the blood stains on your clothes tell a different story,” the police officer in the middle said. “You’re coming with us.” Bob was arrested and taken to court, where he was found guilty on the charges of murder and illegal possession of a firearm, and was sentenced to jail for life.
